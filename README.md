This project demonstartes the usage of View Pager.

The Main Activity is divided in to two parts where the top part has a View Pager to display videos. For playing the videos Exoplayer has been used. The bottom part contains a carousel for displaying images. It is built using the View Pager.

Whenever the ViewPager on the top is scrolled the bottom Carousel scrolls to the exact corresponding position and vice versa based on the id in the consumed API

When an Image is long pressed, the imaage zooms in. The API is consumed using Retrofit and Glide is used to display images.

In this project, Kotlin is used as the primary language and occasionally Java is also used.
